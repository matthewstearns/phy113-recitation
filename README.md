# PHY 113: Intro Mechanics Recitation
University of Massachusetts Dartmouth

## Course Details

- **Course Number:** PHY 113
- **Semester:** Spring 2026
- **Recitation Meeting Times:** Tuesday 1-2pm, 4-5pm. 
- **Location:** SENG 102
- **Recitation Instructor:** Matt 
- **Email:** mstearns1@umassd.edu
- **Office Hours:** Mondays 2-4pm or via zoom
- **Office Location:** SENG203, in the back. 

## Purpose & Overview

This recitation complements the main PHY 113 lecture course and focuses on building problem-solving skills in introductory mechanics. Through guided practice, worked examples, and collaborative problem-solving, we'll deepen your understanding of:

- Kinematics and dynamics
- Energy and momentum conservation
- Motion
- other stuff.. 

The recitation emphasizes conceptual understanding alongside computational skills, helping you apply theoretical concepts to real-world physics problems.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Before recitation:** Review the week's topic and any preparatory materials
2. **During recitation:** Work through guided problems and participate in discussions
3. **After recitation:** Access solutions and additional practice problems for review

## Tips for Success

1. **Start problems early** - Don't wait until the last minute; physics requires time 
2. **Show your work** - Understanding the process matters more than the answer
3. **Ask questions** - Physics is collaborative; learning happens through discussion!!!
4. **Review concepts regularly** - Physics builds on prior knowledge; revisiting earlier topics helps
5. **Practice problems** - Problem-solving skills improve with practice
